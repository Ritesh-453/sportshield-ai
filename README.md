## 🌍 Problem Statement

Sports organizations generate massive volumes of high-value digital media that rapidly
scatter across global platforms. This vast visibility gap leaves proprietary content
highly vulnerable to widespread digital misappropriation, unauthorized redistribution,
and intellectual property violations.

**The scale of the problem:**
- $28B+ lost annually to sports media piracy
- 500M+ sports images shared without authorization every year
- Organizations have no scalable way to detect violations in real-time

---

## 💡 Our Solution

SportShield AI is a scalable digital asset protection platform that uses AI-powered
fingerprinting to detect, track and flag unauthorized use of official sports media.

### How it works
```
Official Asset → Triple-Hash Fingerprint → Asset Registry (Firebase)
                                                    ↓
Suspect Image → Hash Comparison + Gemini AI → Similarity Score → Alert
                                                    ↓
                              Violation Log → PDF Report → Rights Holder
```
